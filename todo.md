# Improvements

0. clean up extra code, I changed so many things I'm sure there's some junk in here
1. 'bootloader'/onMount prompt was put in layout.svelte cause I was having trouble with it; 
it should really be put elsewhere
2. convert to css to sass
3. fix responsiveness; it kinda sucks (esp with smaller heights)
4. higher-rez pictures that match gender (maybe have to pay for this)
5. impvoe prompt to go more off-the-rails & reduce lapses out of character

# New Features

1. refresh-friend button
2. save friend (in cache)
3. (destroy friends button...?)
